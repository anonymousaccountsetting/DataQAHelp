Here are FAQ-like reports to help you understand how to predict {{ycol}} using {%- for i in range(indeNum) %} {{ Xcol[i] }}{%- if i < indeNum - 2 %},{% elif i == indeNum - 2 %} and{% endif -%}{%- endfor %} by fitting the dataset with a Ridge Regression Model.

The R-Squared for the {{modelName}} has a value of {{r2 | round(3)}}.
{%- if r2 < 0.3 %}
 So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is None or Very weak. You might not trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- elif r2 < 0.5 and r2 > 0.3 %}
 So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is Weak or Low. You might use the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- elif r2 < 0.7 and r2 > 0.5 %}
 So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is Moderate. You could trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- else %}
 So, there is a strong relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable. You can trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
