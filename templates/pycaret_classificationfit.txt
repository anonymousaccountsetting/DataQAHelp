The accuracy of the tuned {{modelname}} is {{accuracy | round(3)}},
{%- if accuracy >= 0.9 %} indicating a high accuracy. The classifier's performance is excellent, and the predictions are very reliable.
{%- elif accuracy >= 0.7 and accuracy < 0.9 %} indicating a medium accuracy. The classifier's performance is good, and the predictions are fairly reliable.
{%- elif accuracy >= 0.5 and accuracy < 0.7 %} indicating a low accuracy. The classifier's performance is average, and the predictions are not very reliable.
{%- else %} indicating a very low accuracy. The classifier's performance is poor, and the predictions are unreliable.
{%- endif %}

Additionally, the AUC of the tuned model is {{auc | round(3)}},
{%- if auc >= 0.9 %} which indicates excellent discriminatory ability. The classifier's predictions are very reliable.
{%- elif auc >= 0.8 and auc < 0.9 %} which indicates good discriminatory ability. The classifier's predictions are fairly reliable.
{%- elif auc >= 0.7 and auc < 0.8 %} which indicates fair discriminatory ability. The classifier's predictions are somewhat reliable.
{%- else %} which indicates poor discriminatory ability. The classifier's predictions are unreliable.
{%- endif %}
