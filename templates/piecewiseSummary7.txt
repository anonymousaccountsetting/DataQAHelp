Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are statistical metrics used for model selection; they help in choosing the best statistical model by balancing the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model. The AIC of this model is {{AIC | round(1)}}, and the BIC is {{BIC | round(1)}}. If the AIC and BIC of another model are smaller than these by more than 2, it means that the other model may be a better fit. If they are smaller by more than 6, it means that the other model is significantly better.
