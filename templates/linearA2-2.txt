As depicted in the figure above, when keeping other variables fixed,{%- if (coeff) | round(3)>0%} a one-unit increase in the {{xcol}} results in an increase of {{coeff | round(3)}} in the mean value of the {{ycol}}.
{%- elif (coeff) | round(3)<0 %} a one-unit increase in the {{xcol}} results in a decrease of {{(-coeff) | round(3)}} in the mean value of the {{ycol}}.
{%- elif (coeff) | round(3)==0 %} a one-unit increase in the {{xcol}} will almost not affect the {{ycol}}.{%endif%} Additionally,{%- if p <0.05 %} the P-value is {{ p | round(3)}} which is below the normal significance level of 0.05, indicating that the observed results are statistically significant.
{%- else %} the P-value is {{ p | round(3)}} which is above the normal significance level of 0.05, indicating that the observed results are not statistically significant. {%- endif-%}
