{% set low_mae = 0.2 %}
{% set high_mae = 0.5 %}
Similarly, when analyzing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), we see a consistent pattern in model performance.
{% if train_mae > high_mae and test_mae > high_mae %}
Because both training and testing MAE are high, the model could be underfitting.
{% elif train_mae < low_mae and test_mae > high_mae %}
Because the training MAE is low but the testing MAE is high, the model is overfitting.
{% elif diff > 0.2 %}
Because there is a large difference between training and testing MAE, the model might be overfitting.
{% else %}
The model fits well as both training and testing MAE are low and similar.
{% endif %}
