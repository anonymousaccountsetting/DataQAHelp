The WSSS (within-cluster sum of squares) measures the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. The lower the inertia, the better the model.
Then the elbow point was found by calculating the ratios of consecutive differences in WCSS and finding the index of the minimum ratio.
From the elbow point it suggests the optimal number of clusters is {{best_clusters}}. Please notice that the optimal number of clusters can be subjective and dependent on the specific problem and data being analyzed.
