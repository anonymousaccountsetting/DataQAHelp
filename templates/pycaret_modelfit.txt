The R-squared value for the tuned {{modelname}} is {{r2 | round(3)}},
{%- if r2 < 0.3 %} indicating a very weak or non-existent relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable. You should not trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- elif r2 >= 0.3 and r2 < 0.5 %} indicating a weak or low relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable. Therefore, the analysis provided might not be reliable for making inferences.
{%- elif r2 >= 0.5 and r2 < 0.7 %} indicating a moderate relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable. You might trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- else %} indicating a strong relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable. You can trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- endif %} Additionally, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the tuned model is {{mape | round(3)}}, 
{%- if mape < 0.05 %} which means the forecast of the model is acceptable with good accuracy.
{%- elif mape >= 0.05 and mape < 0.1 %} which means the forecast of the model is acceptably accurate.
{%- elif mape >= 0.1 and mape < 0.25 %} which means the forecast of the model has low accuracy but is still acceptable.
{%- else %} which means the forecast of the model is not acceptable due to its very low accuracy.
{%- endif %}
