{% set low_r2 = 0.6 %}
{% set high_r2 = 0.8 %}
When considering the R-squared values, it's clear that the model's generalization is being evaluated. 
{% if train_r2 < low_r2 and test_r2 < low_r2 %}
Because both training and testing R-squared are low, the model could be underfitting.
{% elif train_r2 > high_r2 and test_r2 < low_r2 %}
Because the training R-squared is high but the testing R-squared is low, the model is overfitting.
{% elif diff > 0.2 %}
Because there is a large difference between training and testing R-squared, the model might be overfitting.
{% else %}
The model fits well as both training and testing R-squared are high and similar.
{% endif %}
