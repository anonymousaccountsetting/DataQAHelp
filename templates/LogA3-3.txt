Overall, the accuracy of the {{modelName}} is {{accuracy | round(3)}}, which indicates that the model is
{%- if accuracy > 0.9 %} excellent
{%- elif accuracy > 0.8 %} good
{%- elif accuracy > 0.7 %} acceptable
{%- else %} in need of improvement
{%- endif %}.

According to the AUC value of {{auc | round(3)}}, the model 
{%- if auc > 0.9 %} has excellent discriminative ability.
{%- elif auc > 0.8 %} has good discriminative ability.
{%- elif auc > 0.7 %} has fair discriminative ability.
{%- elif auc > 0.6 %} has poor discriminative ability.
{%- else %} has failed to discriminate between classes.
{%- endif %}

Based on the deviance divided by the degree of freedom, which is {{ddd | round(3)}}, the model 
{%- if ddd < 2 and ddd >= 1 %} could be considered a moderately good fit for the dataset.
{%- elif ddd < 1 and ddd >= 0.5 %} could be considered a very good fit for the dataset.
{%- elif ddd < 0.5 %} may be overfitting.
{%- else %} may be underfitting.
{%- endif %}

{%- if ss and nss %} Among all factors, {{ss}} show a statistically significant impact on classification results, whereas {{nss}} do not show a statistically significant impact on classification results.
{%- elif ss %} Among all factors, {{ss}} show a statistically significant impact on classification results.
{%- elif nss %} Among all factors, {{nss}} do not show a statistically significant impact on classification results.
{%- endif %} 

{%- if pos and neg %} In addition, {{pos}} will increase the likelihood of having the positive class, and {{neg}} will decrease this likelihood.
{%- elif pos %} In addition, {{pos}} will increase the likelihood of having the positive class.
{%- elif neg %} In addition, {{neg}} will decrease the likelihood of having the positive class.
{%- else %} No specific factors were found to impact the likelihood of having the positive class.
{%- endif %}

{%- if impwithp == imp %} Lastly, {{imp}} is the most influential variable on the classification result.
{%- else %} If we do not consider the p-value of the variables, the most influential variable on the classification result is {{imp}}. However, if we consider the p-value, the most influential variable is {{impwithp}}.
