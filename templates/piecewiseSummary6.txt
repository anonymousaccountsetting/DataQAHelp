Also, the model's Mean Squared Error (MSE) is {{ mse | round(1)}}, which measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. The model's Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is {{ rmse | round(1)}}, which is the square root of MSE and provides an error measure in the same units as the original data. The model's Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is {{ mae | round(1) }}, which measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. These metrics are useful for comparing models; generally, the smaller these values, the better the model's performance.
