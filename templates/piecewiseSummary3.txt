It is worth noting that between the {{xcol}} {{startPoint| round(1)}} and {{endPoint| round(1)}}, {{ycol}} rises from {{yValue1| round(1)}} to {{yValue2| round(1)}}, which is the fastest rise among all segments.
{% elif difference < 0 %}
It is worth noting that between the {{xcol}} {{startPoint| round(1)}} and {{endPoint| round(1)}}, {{ycol}} falls from {{yValue1| round(1)}} to {{yValue2| round(1)}}, which is the fastest fall among all segments.
{% else %}
It is worth noting that between the {{xcol}} {{startPoint| round(1)}} and {{endPoint| round(1)}}, {{ycol}} remains constant at {{yValue1| round(1)}}.
{% endif %}

A one-unit increase in the {{xcol}} results in {{ slope_description }} of {{ slope| abs | round(1) }} in the mean value of the {{ycol}}.
