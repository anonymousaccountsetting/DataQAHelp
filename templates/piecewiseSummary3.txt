It is worth noting that between {{xcol}} being {{startPoint| round(3)}} and {{endPoint| round(3)}}, {{ycol}} rises from {{yValue1}} to {{yValue2}}, which is the fastest rise among all segments.
A one-unit increase in the {{xcol}} results in an increase of {{(slope) | round(3)}} in the mean value of the {{ycol}}.
