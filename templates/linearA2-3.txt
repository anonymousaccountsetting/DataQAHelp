As depicted in the figure above, when keeping other variables fixed,{%- if (coeff) | round(3)>0%} a one-unit increase in the {{xcol}} results in an increase of {{coeff | round(3)}} in the mean value of the {{ycol}}.
{%- elif (coeff) | round(3)<0 %} a one-unit increase in the {{xcol}} results in a decrease of {{(-coeff) | round(3)}} in the mean value of the {{ycol}}.
{%- elif (coeff) | round(3)==0 %} a one-unit increase in the {{xcol}} will almost not affect the {{ycol}}.{%endif%} Additionally,{%- if p <0.05 %} the P-value is {{ p | round(3)}} which is below the normal significance level of 0.05, indicating that the observed results are statistically significant.
{%- else %} the P-value is {{ p | round(3)}} which is above the normal significance level of 0.05, indicating that the observed results are not statistically significant.{% endif%} Also, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for {{ xcol }} is {{ vif_value | round(3) }}. 
{%- if vif_value < 5 %} This indicates that there is no significant multicollinearity problem with {{ xcol }}. A VIF value less than 5 generally suggests that the variable is not highly correlated with other predictors in the model.
{%- elif vif_value >= 5 and vif_value < 10 %} This indicates a moderate level of multicollinearity with {{ xcol }}. A VIF value between 5 and 10 suggests that {{ xcol }} may have some correlation with other predictors, which could affect the stability and interpretation of the model.
{%- else %} This indicates a high level of multicollinearity with {{ xcol }}. A VIF value of 10 or above is a serious concern, indicating that {{ xcol }} is highly correlated with other predictors in the model, which can lead to unreliable estimates and statistical inferences. It is recommended to investigate further and possibly remove or combine variables to address this issue. {% endif %}
