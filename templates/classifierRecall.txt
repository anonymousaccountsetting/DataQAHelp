 the model has poor recall, indicating a high number of false negatives.
{%- elif recall < 0.7 %}
 the model's recall is acceptable, but there's room for improvement.
{%- elif recall < 0.8 %}
 the model has moderately good recall.
{%- elif recall < 0.9 %}
 the model's recall is good.
{%- else %}
 the model has excellent recall, indicating very few false negatives.
{%- endif %}
