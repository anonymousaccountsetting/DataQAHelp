The Silhouette Score ranges from -1 to 1, and a higher score indicates better clustering,
 the score of the model is {{Sscore}}, so
{%- if Sscore >0.5%}
 the model is considered to be a strong structure.
{%- elif Sscore >0.25%}
 the model is considered to be an acceptable structure.
{%- else%}
 the model is considered weak and the clustering may not be meaningful.
{%- endif%}
