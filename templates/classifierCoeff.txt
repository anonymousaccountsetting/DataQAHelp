The coefficients of an SVC (Support Vector Classifier) represent the contribution of each feature to the classification decision boundary, helping to understand and interpret the relative importance of features in the classification task. {% for i, class_name in enumerate(classes) %}For the {{ class_name }} class, {{ Xcol[coefficients[i].argmax()] }} has the greatest influence.{% endfor %} 
Overall, {{ most_influential_feature }} is the most influential variable for the classification results because the average of the absolute value of its coefficient is larger than that of other independent variables.
