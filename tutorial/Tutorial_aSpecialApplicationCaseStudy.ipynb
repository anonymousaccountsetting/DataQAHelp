        "This case study is based on the quarterly report of Aberdeen City's child protection services. It showcases an application based on the DataQAHelper framework that has completed the refinement cycle. The application only requires users to set the correct dataset path and specify the necessary column names to automatically generate a data report. This report covers almost all data-related questions, with the exceptions being questions unrelated to the data. The quarterly report itself consists of 15 questions, and the automatically generated report can cover 7 of these questions.\n"
